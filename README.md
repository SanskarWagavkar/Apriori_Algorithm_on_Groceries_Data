# Apriori_Algorithm_on_Groceries_Data

Apriori Algorithm was implemented on R-inbuilt dataset “Groceries” to gain information such as:

•	It tells us which product is highly associated with each other.

•	Which product is mostly sold next to the product bought.

•	Which product to display on shelf, so as to increase attraction of customers towards the shop.
